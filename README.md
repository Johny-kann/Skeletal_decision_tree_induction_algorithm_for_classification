# Skeletal_decision_tree_induction_algorithm_for_classification
Hunts algorithm is decision tree growth algorithm which is a widely used classification technique in Data mining. 

Features
- The module will construct a decision tree on any data set based on the training records.
- Handles both discrete and continuous attributes and  used multi-way split for continuous and binary split for discrete
- Uses Gini index or Entropy or classication error combined with Gain ratio to find the split attribute
- Builds the decision tree till the node contains only a specific class attribute or reaches a minimum threshold on which it becomes a leaf node
- Measures the accuracy on the training as well as the testing records 

Methodology
- Inheritance and recursion played a key role in the implementation of the algorithm

Programming Language : Java in Model View Controller design pattern
